    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        The Snail family of four (Nelly, Sally, Billy, and Tommy) has lived in Snailand for centuries. One day their home is taken by Baldo the Bado and they are forced to leave their home. The only way to get their home back is to grab what Baldo wants the most,
        a ruby and give it to him. However it is a tough journey with many obstacles and enemies along the way.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        Snails can jump to avoid obstacles and enemies using the spacebar by single tapping to jump or double tapping to go higher. There are three non-moving obstacle types. The enemy moves back and forth on land. The snail must jump to avoid the enemy or obstacle
        otherwise they’ll lose a heart Single tap to jump and double tap to go higher. The highscore will be counted up over time. Once all three hearts are gone it’s the end of the game for the snail and they have to restart from the beginning.
